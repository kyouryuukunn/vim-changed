  1. Setting &termencoding
      Set &termencoding option according to your terminal encoding. 
      Its default value is same as &encoding.
      example:
          set termencoding=cp932
                                                                                                         
  2. Changing signs
      To change signs, re-define signs after sourcing this script.
      example (changing text):
          sign define SIGN_CHANGED_DELETED_VIM text=D texthl=ChangedDefaultHl
          sign define SIGN_CHANGED_ADDED_VIM   text=A texthl=ChangedDefaultHl
          sign define SIGN_CHANGED_VIM         text=M texthl=ChangedDefaultHl
      example (changin highlight @gvimrc):
          highlight ChangedDefaultHl cterm=bold ctermbg=red ctermfg=white gui=bold guibg=red guifg=white
                                                                                                         
  [Usual]
                                                                                                         
  Edit a buffer and wait seconds or execute :Changed.
  Then signs appear on changed lines.
